the next page.)\nTo start reading,\nyou can click on the arrow on the right\nor press your → key\nto go to the next page,\nor you can browse the page index on the left.\nThe project is hosted on Github\nand available to read online at https://guide.encode.moe/.\n"},"CONTRIBUTING.html":{"url":"CONTRIBUTING.html","title":"Contributing to the Guide","keywords":"","body":"Contribution Guidelines\nIf you are interested in supporting\nor contributing to this guide,\nplease keep on reading.\nIf you are not,\nfeel free to skip to the next page.\n\nWe are currently still in the early phases of this guide,\nso any form of contribution,\nincluding just giving feedback,\nis greatly appreciated.\nPlease open an issue on our Github repository\nwith your feedback,\nor begin working on a Pull Request.\nYou can start editing any page\nby clicking on the\n EDIT THIS PAGE\nbutton in the top bar.\nIf you are mainly looking for things to work on,\nrefer to the TODO section.\nGeneral\nLanguage\nThe language of this guide is English.\nAmerican or British English are both acceptable\nand there is no preference for either.\nThe only exceptions are\npages specific to a particular language,\nfor example with references to online dictionaries\nor official grammar rule books,\nor other typographic advices,\nfor example concerning the usage of quotation marks.\nWhen adding such a page,\nplease briefly describe in your Pull Request\nwhat the text is about,\nwhat topics it covers,\nand, if necessary,\nwhy it only applies to a specific language.\nTechnology\nThis guide is written in Markdown\nand uses legacy gitbook's toolchain to compile\nthe static HTML pages.\nGitbook uses the Github Flavoured Markdown (GFM) variant.\nIn order to build and preview the guide locally,\nyou need npm and node.js.\nThe former is usually bundled with installation packages for node.\nOnce you have those installed,\nrun the following commands\nfrom the repository's folder:\n$ npm install\nadded 611 packages from 674 contributors in 4.478s\n\n$ ./node_modules/.bin/gitbook install\ninfo: installing 5 plugins using npm@3.9.2\n…\n\n$ ./node_modules/.bin/gitbook serve --open\nLive reload server started on port: 35729\nPress CTRL+C to quit ...\ninfo: 12 plugins are installed\ninfo: loading plugin \"highlight\"... OK\n…\ninfo: found 11 pages\ninfo: found 21 asset files\n…\ninfo: >> generation finished with success in 1.6s !\nStarting server ...\nServing book on http://localhost:4000\n\nAfterwards, your browser will have opened\nwith a preview of your files.\nAny changes you make to the source .md files\nwill cause your browser to be refreshed\nand automatically reloaded.\nAdding a New Page\nIn order for your page to be accessible,\nyou need to add it to the SUMMARY.md file.\nThe title used there will be used in the navigation bar,\nso keep it short.\nTODO\nVarious sections are still under construction.\nYou will occasionally find TODO as verbatim text\nor within comments.\nOur goal is to have a section\nwith one or more pages\nfor each of the roles\nspecified in the roles page.\nFeel free to work on any of the TODO marks\nor create a new section.\nCurrently, we aim to add the following topics\nin no particular priority:\n\nWorkflow\nTranslation\nEdit\nTiming\nBasic Procedure\nSnapping\nJoining, Splitting\nPost-processing (TPP & Useful Scripts)\nShifting & Sushi\nKaraoke\n\n\nTypesetting\n…with Aegisub\nStyling (of dialogue)\nSigns\nPositioning, Layers, Rotation, Perspective, …\n\n\nMasking\nAutomation Scripts\nMovement & Motion Tracking\n\n\n…with Adobe Illustrator\n(…with Adobe After Effects)\n\n\nEncoding [I'm sure there's something to be done]\nQuality Check\nKaraoke Effects\n\nThere is a collection of links here that can be used as reference\nwhen working on any future section.\nStyle Guidelines\nThe following are the style guidelines\nfor various aspects of this guide.\nThe most important aspect is having Semantic Linefeeds.\nThe other points may serve as guidelines for formatting future pages.\nRefer to gitbook's markdown documentation1\nfor guidelines on visual formatting.\nSemantic Linefeeds (!)\nAlways use Semantic Linefeeds when editing text.\nThey are used\nto break lines into logical units\nrather than after a certain line length threshold is reached!\nThey drastically improve sentence parsing\nin the human brain\nand make code diffing much more simple\ncompared to hard-wrapping at 80 columns.\nYou should still aim\nnot to exceed 80 columns in a single line,\nbut unless you are writing code or URLs,\nyou will most likely not have any problems with this.\nMarkdown will collapse adjacent lines into a paragraph,\nso you don't have to worry about the rendered result.\nAs a rule of thumb,\nalways start a new line on\na comma,\na period,\nany other sentence terminating punctuation,\nparenthesized sentences (not words),\nor new items in a long list\n(such as the one you are reading right now).\nFootnotes are an exception and must be written all on one line.\nIndentation\nThe indent size is two spaces.\nLists\nUnordered list lines should be indented once,\nwhile ordered lists are indented twice.\nThe text of an unordered item should have one space after the -,\nwhile the text of an ordered item\nshould start four columns after the number.\n- This is an unordered list\n  - With a sublist\n  - And another item in that sublist\n\n1.  This is an ordered list.\n    Consecutive lines are indented with four spaces.\n2.  Another list item\n…\n10.

They are:\n\nEncoder\nTimer\nTypesetter\nEditor\nQuality Checker\nOptional: Translator\nOptional: Translation Checker\nOptional: Karaoke Effects Creator\nOptional: Project Leader\n\nIn this guide, we will only be providing in-depth guides for the\nEncoder, Timer, and Typesetter roles.\nHowever, Quality Checkers are often expected to be familiar with\nmost or all of the roles in order to recognize errors.\nThis page serves as just an overview of the work\nvarious roles will be expected to complete.\nEncoder\nTime commitment per episode: 20 minutes - 2 hours active (4-12 hours\ninactive)\nEncoders (sometimes abbreviated as ENC) are responsible for the audio\nand video.\nThey will generally be provided with one or more video sources\nand are expected to produce the best video possible within reason.\nThis is done with a frame-by-frame video processor such as AviSynth\nand VapourSynth1,\na video encoder such as x264 or x2652,\nand audio tools such as eac3to,\nqaac,\nand FLAC3.\nThis is not a comprehensive list,\nbut it does represent the broad categories of tools required.\nEncoders are expected to have a high level of skill and understanding of\nvideo concepts and tools.\nIt is perhaps the most technically challenging role in fansubbing.\nHowever, much of the work is repeatable,\nas each episode in a show will usually be very similar to every other one.\nIt will also get easier over time as they become more familiar with the\nconcepts and tools.\nOne last note about encoding: there are as many opinions about how to\nfix video problems as there are encoders.\nEncoders can and often do become contentious about their work,\ntheories,\nand scripts.\nIt's important to keep in mind that a disagreement is not always an insult,\nand more experienced encoders often just want to help and provide feedback.\nThe important part is the result!\nTimer\nTime commitment per episode: 20 minutes - 4 hours\nThe Timer (abbreviated TM) is responsible for when the text\nrepresenting spoken dialogue shows up on screen.\nThe timing of subtitles is much more important than one might assume.\nThe entrance and exit times of the subtitles,\nor a fluid transition from one line to the next,\ncan make a large impact on the \"watchability\" of the episode as a whole.\nTake, for example,\nthis clip from Eromanga-sensei.\nOn the left are the official subtitles from Amazon's AnimeStrike,\nand on the right is a fansub release.\nThere are many problems with Amazon's subtitles:\nentering and exiting the screen up to two seconds late,\npresenting 4-5 lines on screen at once,\nand not separating dialogue based on speaking character.\nThese problems detract from the viewing experience,\ndrawing attention to the appearance of the subtitles\nand distracting from the story and video.\nTypesetter\nTime commitment per episode: 20 minutes - 8+ hours (dependent on number\nand difficulty of signs)\nTypesetters (abbreviated TS) are responsible for the visual\npresentation of translated text on-screen. These are generally called signs.\nFor example, given this scene and a translation of \"Adachi Fourth Public High School\"…\nImage 1.4.1 - [DameDesuYo] Eromanga-sensei - 01 (1920x1080 10bit AAC) [05CB518E].mkv_snapshot_03.11_[2017.08.18_21.14.55].jpg\nthe Typesetter would be expected to produce something like\nthis:\nImage 1.4.2 - [DameDesuYo] Eromanga-sensei - 01 (1920x1080 10bit AAC) [05CB518E].mkv_snapshot_03.11_[2017.08.18_21.14.43].jpg\nAlmost every sign the Typesetter works on will be unique,\nrequiring ingenuity,\na wild imagination,\na sense of style,\nand a high degree of attention to detail.\nThe Typesetter's goal is to produce something that integrates so\nwell into the video that the viewer does not realize that it is actually\npart of the subtitles.\nThe sign above is actually one of the more simple kinds that the Typesetter might\nhave to deal with.\nIt is static, meaning it does not move,\nand has plenty of room around it to place the translation.\nOther signs will be much more difficult.\nTake for example this scene from Kobayashi-san Chi no\nMaid Dragon.\nThough it may be hard to believe,\nthe typesetting on the right side of the screen was done entirely\nwith softsubs (using Aegisub),\nsubtitles that can be turned on and off in the video player\nas compared to hardsubs (using Adobe After Effects) which are burned in.\nEach group and language \"scene\" will have different standards\nin regards to soft and hardsubs.\nFor example, in the English scene,\nhardsubs are considered highly distasteful,\nwhereas in the German scene they are readily accepted.\nSomething to remember about typesetting is that there is no one way to\ntypeset a sign.\nThere are, however,\nincorrect ways that are not visually pleasing,\ndo not match the original well,\nare difficult to read,\nor are too heavy (meaning computer resource intensive).\nEditor\nTime commitment per episode: 2-4+ hours\nThe Editor (sometimes abbreviated ED) is responsible for making sure that\nthe script reads well.\nDepending on the source of the script,\nthis may mean grammatical corrections and some rewording\nto address recommendations from the Translation Checker.\nHowever, more often than not,\nthe job will entail rewriting,\nrewording,\nand characterizing large portions of the script.\nEach group will have different expectations of an Editor\nin terms of the type,\nstyle,\nand number of changes made.\nThe Editor may also be responsible\nfor making corrections recommended by the Quality Checkers.\nQuality Checker\nTime commitment per episode: 30 minutes to 4 hours (depending on your\nown standards)\nQuality Checkers (abbreviated QC) are often the last eyes on an\nepisode before it is released.\nThey are responsible for ensuring that the overall quality\nof the release is up to par with the group's standards.\nThey are also expected to be familiar with the workflow\nand many intricacies of every other role.\nEach group has a different approach to how the Quality Checker\ncompletes their work.\nFor example, one group might require an organized \"QC report\"\nwith recommended changes and required fixes,\nwhile other groups may prefer the Quality\nChecker to make changes directly to the script whenever possible.\nTranslator & Translation Checker\nTime commitment per episode: 1-3 hours for translation check,\n4+ hours for an original translation (dependent on the skill of the TL/TLC\nand the difficulty of the show's original script)\nThe job of the Translator (abbreviated TL) and the Translation Checker\n(abbreviated TLC) is to translate and ensure the translational quality\nof the script and signs respectively.\nThis is perhaps an obvious statement,\nbut it bears explaining just in case.\nToday, many shows are simulcast by one or more companies,\nmeaning scripts will be available either immediately or soon after airing in Japan.\nIn these cases, some fansub groups may choose to edit\nand check the simulcast script rather than translate it from scratch.\nThis depends almost entirely on the quality of the simulcast.\nFixing a bad simulcast script may be harder than doing an \noriginal translation (abbreviated OTL).\nFinally, translators are responsible for transcribing and translating\nopening,\nending,\nand insert songs as well.\nKaraoke Effect Creator\nTime commitment: several hours, once or twice per season\nThe Karaoke Effect Creator (abbreviated KFX) styles and\nadds effects to the lyrics and sometimes romaji and/or kanji for\nopening,\nending,\nand insert songs.\nThis can be very similar to typesetting\nbut utilizes a different set of tools\nand can be highly programming-oriented.\n\n\n1.

Software\nWhile the term \"encoding\" originally just referred\nto the opposite of decoding—that is,\ncompressing raw video with a video codec—the term\nhas a broader meaning in the context of fansubbing.\nHere, \"encoding\" includes the entire process\nfrom receiving the source video until the final release.\nUsual steps are processing or filtering\nof the original video to remove defects,\ncompressing the video in a way that does not generate new artifacts,\ntranscoding audio to the desired format,\nand muxing video,\naudio,\nsubtitles,\nfonts,\nand other attachments into a container,\nsuch as mkv.\nEach of these steps requires different tools which will be listed and\nexplained in the following paragraphs.\nIt is assumed that you already have a source video at this point,\nso software like torrent clients,\nPerfect Dark,\nShare,\nor even FileZilla will not be covered.\nIf you don't have a reliable way to get raws\nand if your group doesn't provide them,\ntry finding a source first.\nPrivate bittorrent trackers like u2\nor AsianDVDClub are good starting points.\nProcessing and Filtering\nThe Frameserver\nIn order to process your source video\n(which will be called \"raw\" throughout this chapter),\nyou need to import it into a so-called \"frameserver\",\na software that is designed to process a video frame-by-frame,\nusually based on a script that defines various filters\nwhich will be applied to the video.\nCurrently, only two widely-known frameservers exist:\nAvisynth and VapourSynth.\nWhile many (especially older) encoders still use Avisynth,\nthere is no reason to use it\nif you're just starting to learn encoding.1\nMost Avisynth users only use it because\nthey have years of experience and\ndon't want to switch.\nSince this guide is aimed towards new encoders,\nand the author has no qualms about imposing his own\nopinions onto the host of people willing to listen,\nthe guide will focus on VapourSynth.\nAvisynth equivalents are provided for certain\nfunctions where applicable,\nbut the sample code will always be written for VapourSynth.\nThat being said, the installation of VapourSynth is quite easy.\nIt is strongly recommended to install the 64-bit version\nof all tools listed here.\nVapourSynth requires Python 3.7 or newer\n(which can be downloaded here).\nVapourSynth Windows binaries can be found\nhere.\nLinux users will have to build their own version,\nbut if you're on Linux,\nyou probably know how to do that.\nDuring the installation,\nyou might be prompted to install the Visual C++ Redistributables.\nJust select \"Yes\" and the installer will do it for you.\nAnd that's it.\nYou can test your VapourSynth installation by opening the\nPython shell and typing:\n>>> import vapoursynth\n\nIf the installation was not successful,\nyou should receive an error that reads:\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"\", line 1, in \nImportError: No module named 'vapoursynth'\nIn that case,\nmake sure your current Python shell is the correct version\n(Python version as well as architecture),\ntry restarting your PC,\nreinstall VapourSynth,\nor ask for help.\nPlugins\nIn addition to VapourSynth’s core plugins,\ncommunity-created scripts and plugins\ncan be installed to extend the functionality of the frameserver.\nThese are usually more specific than the universally usable core plugins\nor they are collections of wrappers and functions.\nA (non-exhaustive) list of plugins and scripts is available in the\nofficial documentation.\nAdditionally, an extensive database of VapourSynth plugins and scripts\nis available at VSDB.\nVSDB also offers a GUI for vsrepo,\nVapourSynth’s official package manager,\nand a plugin pack (labeled “Portable FATPACK”)\nthat bundles most popular plugins,\nscripts, and VS-related applications into one archive\nfor ease of download and installation.\nAn alternative to the latter is eXmendiC’s encode pack,\nwhich contains a lot of encoding-related applications and scripts,\non top of a broad collection of VapourSynth plugins and scripts.\nHowever, the package is not maintained anymore,\nand may in part include outdated software.\nThe Editor\nNow that you have installed the frameserver,\nyou can start filtering the video.\nBut without an editor,\nyou have no means of previewing the results other than test encodes\nor raw output into a file.\nThat's why editors exist.\nThey provide useful features such as autocompletion,\ntooltips,\npreview images,\nand comparisons.\nThere are four editors that can be used to preview your\nVapourSynth-Script.\n\nVSEdit.\nIt is a small editor software that can run on your PC. It can be\ndownloaded\nhere.\nIt provides an easy and simple GUI to write your VapourSynth\nscripts.\nImage 2.1.1 - The main window of VSEdit.\nWhile it seems to be unstable on some systems, its high performance\npreview window offsets its problems.\n\nYuuno. While it is not an editor, Yuuno\nis an extension to a Python-shell-framework that runs inside your\nbrowser.\nThis increases latency, but it gives you a wider range of preview\nrelated features while being more stable than VSEdit. It should be\nnoted that Yuuno natively supports remote access, as it is only an\nextension for Jupyter Notebook.\nImage 2.1.2 - A Jupyter Notebook.\n\nVapourSynth Multi-Viewer.\nMulti-Viewer is a very simple and elementary previewing tool.\nWhile the text editing is vastly inferior to VSEdit’s,\nand the preview lacks a lot of VSEdit’s advanced features,\nits tab-based previewing functionality easily outclasses\nVSEdit’s single preview window,\nbecause it makes comparisons between different script versions\na lot more convenient and efficient.\nIn short: very useful for thorough comparisons and filter fine-tuning,\nnot so much for everything else.\nImage 2.1.3 - VS Multi-Viewer’s editing window.\nImage 2.1.4 - VS Multi-Viewer’s preview window.\n\nAvsPmod. This is the\neditor for AviSynth. It is old and slow but stable. When you are\nusing AviSynth, you are limited to this editor. AvsPmod can handle\nAviSynth and VapourSynth scripts, however, VapourSynth support was\nan afterthought and is therefore experimental, unstable, and\n\"hacky\".\nDo not use AvsPmod for VapourSynth scripts unless you have a very\ngood reason!\n\n\nPlease rest assured that the author does not impose any editor on you.\nInstead we will give callouts for some editors.\nThese will be completely optional.\nVideo Codecs\nOnce you are happy with the result of your filter chain,\nyou want to save the output to a file.\nWhile it is possible to store the script's output as raw,\nuncompressed pixel data,\nthat would result in hundreds of gigabytes of data for a single episode.\nBecause of this,\nwe use video codecs to compress the video.\nLossless compression will still result in very big files,\nso we have to use lossy compression,\nwhich means losing some information in the process.\nAs long as you're not targeting unreasonable bitrates\n(say, 50 MB per 24 minute episode),\nthis loss of information should be barely noticeable.\nThis process can be quite difficult,\nso there will be an entire page dedicated to it.\nNone of the encoders mentioned here need to be installed.\nJust save the executable(s) somewhere for later.\nFor now, all you need to know is which codecs exist\nand which encoders you want to use.\nThe codec used most commonly is h.264,\nand the most popular h.264 encoder is x264.\nThe most recent builds can be found on VideoLAN's site.\nPick the most recent build for your operating system.\nAt the time of writing this,\nwin64's recent build is x264-r2935-545de2f.exe\nfrom 25-Sep-2018.\n(Notice: the 10-bit binaries are no longer separate from the 8-bit\nas of 24 Dec 2017,\nmeaning the releases with -10b can be ignored)\nYou can also build it locally from the public repository.\nIt used to be that different versions,\nnamely kmod and tmod,\nwere required for certain exclusive encoding features\nsuch as \"aq-mode 3\".\nHowever, all relevant features have been included in the upstream\nx264 builds since August 2018.\nA newer, more efficient alternative is HEVC,\nwith x265 being the most popular encoder.\nIt is still in active development\nand aims for 20-50% lower bitrates with the same quality as x264.\nIt does have its flaws,\nis a lot slower,\nand not as widely supported by media players as x264,\nbut it can be a viable alternative,\nespecially if small files are important\nand encoding time is of secondary importance.\nNote that many groups will require you to use x264,\nso ask your group leader before picking this encoder.\nOther codecs, such as VP9,\nare generally not used for fansubbing,\nso they are not listed here.\nThe same is true for experimental codecs like Daala and AV-1.\nEncoders made for distributed server encoding,\nsuch as Intel's SVT-AV1 will also not be included.\nAudio\nAudio formats and how to handle them\nDepending on the source you'll be working with,\nyou may encounter many different audio formats.\nOn Blu-rays,\nyou will most likely find audio encoded losslessly,\nin the form of either DTS-HD Master Audio, Dolby TrueHD, or PCM.\nDTS-HD MA and Dolby THD are proprietary codecs that use lossless compression,\nwhile PCM is simply raw, uncompressed PCM data.\nThe usual way to handle these\nis to reencode them to other formats—either lossless or lossy,\ndepending on your taste.\nBut first, you need to decode them.\nThe recommended tool for that is FFmpeg.\nYou can find Windows builds and Linux packages\non FFmpeg's official site.\nIt doesn't need to be installed—you can just extract it somewhere.\nBut, since it is useful for many different tasks,\nadding it to the system PATH is recommeded.\nWhen working with WEB and TV sources,\nyou will most likely have only lossy audio available.\nThe most common codecs here are AC-3, E-AC-3 and AAC.\nLossily compressed files should generally\nnot be reencoded—the proper way to handle them\nis to remux (i.e. copy) them to the final file.\nWhich codecs to use?\nOnce you have your lossless files decoded, you need to encode them.\nDepending on your taste, you can choose a lossy or lossless codec.\nThe two most widely accepted codecs in fansubbing community are FLAC (lossless)\nand AAC (lossy), but recently opus (also lossy) is gaining some popularity, too.\nThe recommended encoder for FLAC is the official one.\nDownload Windows builds from xiph's website.\nMost Linux distributions should have FLAC in their package repositories.\nThe recommended and most widely used AAC encoder is qaac,\navailable on its official site.\nNero and Fraunhofer FDK aren't really that much worse,\nso you can use them if you really want.\nOther AAC encoders are discouraged,\nsince they provide inferior results.\nThere is also opus, which is gaining some popularity recently.\nIt is currently the most efficient lossy codec,\nand it's completely FOSS if you're into that.\nThe recommended opus encoder is the official one,\ncontained in the opus-tools package.\nJust as with video,\nthese encoders don't need to be installed.\nQaac will require some configuration, tho.\nOther codecs are generally not recommended.\nFormats like Monkey's Audio and TAK provide very little gain over FLAC,\nwhile not being as widely supported,\nand—in the case of TAK—closed source.\nDTS-HD MA and Dolby THD are much less efficient than FLAC,\nand are also closed source.\nMP3 is simply obsolete,\nand Vorbis has been superseded by opus.\nDTS and AC-3 provide even worse compression than MP3,\nand don't have any reasonable, free encoders.\nIn short—don't bother,\nunless you really have to, for some reason.\nLossless or lossy?\nThis is entirely dependent on you.\nSome people like the idea of having a (theoretically)\nperfect copy of the master audio file,\ndon't mind the increase in size,\nand state that lossless is the only way to go when archiving.\nOthers prefer smaller file sizes,\nknowing that the difference—assuming high enough bitrate—won't\nbe audible anyway.\nAnd they both have a point.\nSo, do some ABX testing and decide for yourself.\nMKVToolNix\nYou probably have at least three files now—that being the video,\naudio,\nand subtitles—and you need to combine all of them into a single file.\nThis process is called muxing.\nMKVToolNix is used to mux all parts of the final output\ninto an mkv container.\nMost people use MKVToolNix GUI,\nwhich provides a graphical user interface to mux video,\naudio,\nchapters,\nfonts,\nand other attachments\ninto an mkv file.\nInstallation instructions for virtually any platform\ncan be found on their website.\nIt is possible to use other containers,\nbut Matroska has become the standard for video releases\ndue to its versatility and compatibility.\n\n\n1. It should be noted that the author strongly disagrees with this sentiment.

Blocky Compression\nImage 2.3.5 - Blocky Exaggeration\n(Urban, 2017)\n\nFrom Biamp's Blog2:\n\"Blocking is known by several names – including tiling,\njaggies,\nmosaicing,\npixelating,\nquilting,\nand checkerboarding –\nand it occurs whenever a complex (compressed) image\nis streamed over a low bandwidth connection\n(imagine a golf ball being passed through a garden hose).\nAt decompression,\nthe output of certain decoded blocks makes surrounding pixels\nappear averaged together to look like larger blocks.\" (Urban, 2017)\nThankfully most blocking in BDs and web streams nowadays isn’t\nnearly as bad,\nand can either be ignored or removed\nby another stage in your filter chain3.\nDenoising,\ndebanding,\nand adding grain will all help to reduce blocking.\nNoise\nAs stated earlier,\nnoise and grain are often used interchangeably.\nVisually, noise looks uglier and more out of place than grain.\nIt's less defined and can look blotchy,\nblocky,\nor be made up of small dots,\nwhereas grain looks like a proper texture.\nIn some cases,\nheavy random grain may be added and then encoded with a low bitrate,\nresulting in large,\nnoisy,\nblocky,\nunstable grain in the video.\nThis is often impossible to remove without noticeable detail loss,\nand in this case scenefiltering and heavy detail loss\nare the only two options.\nBanding\nImage 2.3.6 - Example image for banding\nDue to with its many flat areas and smooth gradients,\nbanding is a frequent problem in anime,\nwhich is caused by caused by the limits of 8-bit color depth\nand (especially in low bitrate sources) truncation.\nThe filter GradFun3 is the most common tool for removing it,\nand is the right tool for the job in average cases.\nSome other options are available if this isn’t enough:\nParticularly large quantization errors,\nworse banding in dark scenes,\nand/or banding with grain are cases where\nexperimenting with a few masking/limiting techniques\nor scene-filtering may be the best option.\nAliasing\nAliasing has a few main causes:\ninterlacing,\nlow bitrate encoding,\nshitty sharpening,\nand shitty upscaling\n(the latter two are often accompanied by ringing).\nIn the case of resizing,\nthe descale plugin with the right settings\nmay be enough to alleviate the aliasing,\nbut bear in mind that the poorer your source video is,\nthe less effective it will be.\nIn other cases,\nan edge directed interpolation filter,\nnormally used for deinterlacing,\nis used to smooth the edges.\nThese include nnedi3,\needi3,\nEEDI2,\nand sangnom2.\nThe process involves supersampling and\n(re-)interpolating lines in an attempt to minimize detail loss and\nmaximize continuity.\nMasking is very common,\nand is always recommended.\nThere are one or two other methods,\nthe most common of which is a filter called daa.\nIt's sometimes used,\nbut outside of bad interlacing-related aliasing,\nit is rarely recommendable.\nRinging\nRinging is something of a blanket term for edge artifacts,\nincluding mosquito noise,\nedge enhancement artifacts,\novershoot,\nor actual ring-like ringing caused by the Gibbs phenomenon.\nImage 2.3.7 - Mosquito Noise\n(Urban, 2017)\n\nIn Blu-ray encodes,\nthe only ringing you’ll be likely to see is\nupscaling methods such as Lanczos and sharp Bicubic variants,\nor possibly from badly done sharpening.\nThis is because ringing is primarily a compression artifact,\nand BDs are generally high bitrate,\nand even bad BDs don’t tend to ring much.\nThus, you are much more likely to see ringing in low bitrate webrips\nand MPEG2 TV captures.\nDespite it being a vastly inferior codec,\nringing in MPEG2 sources is actually much easier to deal with than the\nstubborn ringing in H.264 encodes.\nIn these cases,\na simple smoothing based edge-scrubber like HQDeringmod,\nor a warpsharp-based scrubber similar to EdgeCleaner\nit has a shitty mask) should all work just fine\nwithout too many drawbacks.\nIn the case of heavily compressed H.264 sources,\nconsider doing a manual masking/limiting/filtering,\nor scenefiltering with some of HQDeringmod’s safety-checks disabled\n(change repair from default 24 to 23,\nor disable entirely)\nHaloing\nAnother edge artifact,\nthis time much cleaner and easier to spot.\nHalos (especially in anime) are exactly as their title would imply;\nan even,\nthick,\nbrightness surrounding lines.\nIn some cases they might even seem like they’re supposed to be there.\nIn Blu-rays this is rarely a problem,\nbut if you do come across it,\na masked dehalo_alpha filter such as Fine_Dehalo\nor a manual filtering of dehalo_alpha with dhhmask\n(zzfunc.py coming soon™) are recommendable.\nCross-Field Noise\nImage 2.3.8 - field-noise.jpg\nTODO\nUnderflow / Overflow\nWhile most of the anime produced\nuse the YUV 8-bit limited range4,\nwe occasionally find some videos having the \"limited range\" flag set\nwhile containing full range content.\nThis often results in oversaturated colors and weird brightness.\nThus, it is strongly recommended\nto check the brightness levels\nof the 8-bit source with hist.Levels().\nImage 2.3.9 - Example of underflow (click for comparison)\nImage 2.3.10 - Example of overflow (click for comparison)\nTo fix this problem,\nsimply use std.Levels() like so:\n# This only applies to 8 bit clips!\nclip = clip.std.Levels(min_in=0, max_in=255, min_out=16, max_out=235, planes=0)      # y plane\nclip = clip.std.Levels(min_in=0, max_in=255, min_out=16, max_out=240, planes=[1,2])  # u&v planes\n\nor set the \"full range\" flag on the video,\nso the values can be interpreted accordingly.\nLimited range video is more widely supported\nand players may ignore the \"full range\" flag,\nwhich results in interpreting full range content \nin a limited context.\nBecause limited precision with only 8 bit per channel\nmay lead to rounding errors quickly,\nwe prefer adjusting the levels\n(and our filtering in general)\nwith higher precision, \nsuch as 16 bit or float (32 bit).\nFor these clips,\nyou would use the following5:\n# 16 bit\nclip = clip.std.Levels(min_in=0, max_in=2**16 - 1, min_out=16 \nAn example for a case,\nwhere shifting the levels with 8 bit precision\nleads to rounding errors \nthat may result in banding\nand other weird artifacts,\ncan be seen below.\nImage 2.3.11 -

Blocking may also occur for other reasons other than compression data loss. Image re-construction with padding can cause very similar looking effects, although this is irrelevant for fansubbing source videos. ↩\n\n\n4. The 8-bit limited range (used in rec.601 and rec.709) (and also BT.2020/2100) only defines values within [16,235] for the Y and [16,240] for the U and V planes. This means that Y=16 is considered full black and Y=235 full white, while any values outside of that range are clamped virtually (during rendering). U and V behave analogously.  ↩\n\n\n5. The limited ranges in different precisions are shifted by (multiplied by 2 to the power of) the added bits. For 12-bit, for example, you muliply by 2\\^(12-8), resulting in [256,3760] and [256-3840] respectively. The maximum value in full range is obviously the highest unsigned integer value, so 2**12-1. ↩\n\n"},"encoding/scenefiltering.html":{"url":"encoding/scenefiltering.html","title":"Scenefiltering","keywords":"","body":"Scenefiltering\nScenefiltering can be hazardous to both your mind and body if used\nextensively. Avoid scenefiltering if possible.\nIf you're an aspiring young encoder or someone who has been around\nfansubbing for a while, you've probably heard the term \"scenefiltering\".\nBut what is scenefiltering? As the name suggests, it is simply filtering\ndifferent scenes or frames of a video clip distinctly.\nCreating the base filters\nNormally, if you have a source that has great video quality with minimal\nvideo artifacts, you can use a simple chain of filters on the entire\nvideo without any concern. However, if you have a more complex source\nwith a myriad of video artefacts, you probably don't want to use the\nsame filters everywhere. For instance, one scene could have heavy\nbanding while another scene might have strong aliasing. If you were to\nfix both of these issues by using strong filtering over the entire\nvideo, it would likely result in detail loss in other scenes, which you\ndo not want. This is where scenefiltering comes in.\nAs always, you start by importing the VapourSynth module and loading\nyour video source:\nimport vapoursynth as vs  # this can look different based on your editor\ncore = vs.core\n\nsrc = core.lsmas.LWLibavSource(\"source.m2ts\")\n\nNext, you need to choose what filtering will be done to the entire clip.\nSome filtering—like resizing in this example—may\nneed to be put before any other filtering.\nAt this stage,\nyou can also come up with the default filters\nthat need to be in a certain order,\nbut will still be applied to the entire clip.\nIf you can't come up with anything suitable, don't fret;\nyou'll have plenty more chances to filter later.\nfiltered = core.resize.Bilinear(src, width=1280, height=720)\n\n# will occur at the deband stage, but for entire clip\ndefault_deband = deband(filtered)\n\nNow that you have your common filtering down, you need to create some\nbase filter chains. Go through some random scenes in your source and\nwrite down parts of the filtering that best suits those scenes. You\nshould separate these as variables with proper names and sorting (group\nfilters by their type) to keep everything neat and clean. If you do this\npart well, you will save yourself a lot of time later on, so take your\ntime. At this point, your script should look something like this:\nimport vapoursynth as vs\ncore = vs.core\n\nsrc = core.lsmas.LWLibavSource(\"source.m2ts\")\nresized = core.resize.Bilinear(src, width=1280, height=720)\n\nlight_denoise = some_denoise_filter(resized)\nheavy_denoise = some_other_denoise_filter(resized)\n\ndenoised = ...\n\naa = antialiasing(denoised)\n\naa = ...\n\ndefault_deband = deband(aa)\nlight_deband   = deband1(aa)\nmedium_deband  = deband2(aa)\n\ndebanded = ...\n\nAdding the frame ranges\nOnce you've done all of that, you're done with filtering your source—at\nleast for the most part. Now all you need to do is add\nReplaceFramesSimple calls. For this, you need either the\nplugin RemapFrames or\nthe native Python version in\nfvsfunc1.\nRfs is a shorthand for ReplaceFramesSimple\nand fvsfunc has the alias rfs.\nimport vapoursynth as vs\ncore = vs.core\n\nsrc = core.lsmas.LWLibavSource(\"source.m2ts\")\nresized = core.resize.Bilinear(src, width=1280, height=720)\n\n### Denoising\nlight_denoise   = some_denoise_filter(resized)\nheavy_denoise   = some_other_denoise_filter(resized)\nheavier_denoise = some_stronger_denoise_filter(resized)\n\ndenoised = core.remap.Rfs(resized, light_denoise, mappings=\"\")\ndenoised = core.remap.Rfs(denoised, heavy_denoise, mappings=\"\")\ndenoised = core.remap.Rfs(denoised, heavier_denoise, mappings=\"\")\n\n### Anti-aliasing\needi2_aa  = eedi2_aa_filter(denoised)\nnnedi3_aa = nnedi3_aa_filter(denoised)\n\naa = core.remap.Rfs(denoised, eedi2_aa, mappings=\"\")\naa = core.remap.Rfs(aa, nnedi3_aa, mappings=\"\")\n\n### Debanding\ndefault_deband = default_deband(aa)\nlight_deband   = deband1(aa)\nmedium_deband  = deband2(aa)\n\ndebanded = default_deband  # will apply filter to the entire clip\ndebanded = core.remap.Rfs(debanded, light_deband, mappings=\"\")\ndebanded = core.remap.Rfs(debanded, med_deband, mappings=\"\")\n\nSo you created all your base filters and added Rfs calls. Now what? You\nstill have to perform the most tedious part of this entire\nprocess—adding frame ranges to those calls. The basic workflow is\nquite simple:\n\nGo to the start of the scene. View the next 2-3 frames. Go to the\nend of the scene. View the previous 2-3 frames. Based on this,\ndecide on your filtering for the particular scene. If still in\ndoubt, look at other frames in the scene. Sometimes, you will find\nthat different frames in the same scene require different filtering,\nbut this is quite uncommon.\nNow that you know what filter to use, simply add the frame range to\nthe respective Rfs call. To add a frame range to Rfs, you need to\nenter it as a string in the mappings parameter. The format for the\nstring is [start_frame end_frame]. If you only want to add a\nsingle frame, the format is frame_number. An example should help\nyou understand\nbetter:\n# The following replaces frames 30 to 40 (inclusive) and frame 50\n# of the base clip with the filtered clip.\nfiltered = core.remap.Rfs(base, filtered, mappings=\"[30 40] 50\")\n\n\nRepeat with the next scene.\n\n\nWhen scenefiltering, it is good practice to comment out Rfs calls you're\ncurrently not using because they just make your script slower and eat up\nmemory.\nThis step can take anywhere from a few minutes to hours, depending on\nthe encoder and the source. Most of the time, the same filters can be\nreused every episode with some minor changes here and there.\nNow you might ask, \"Why did I have to create base filters for\neverything?\" The answer is that these base filters allow other filters\nto be added on top of them. Let's say a scene requires light_denoise\nbut also needs medium_deband on top of that. Just put the same frame\nranges in their Rfs calls and watch it happen. What if a scene requires\ndenoising stronger than heavier_denoise ? Simple. Add another denoising\nfilter instead of heavier_denoise like so:\nsuper_heavy_denoise = ultra_mega_super_heavy_denoise(filtered)\n\nfiltered = core.remap.Rfs(filtered, super_heavy_denoise, mappings=\"[x y]\")\n\nUsing different denoisers on that same frame range is also possible, but\nalways consider the impacts on performance. Calling a strong, slow\ndenoise filter might still be faster (and better-looking) than calling a\nweak, faster filter multiple times.\nEditor shortcuts / tips\nIf using VSEdit as your editor,\nit can be helpful to use the\nbuilt-in bookmark functionality\nto find the frame ranges of each scene.\nThere is a small script that can generate\nthese bookmarks from your clip inside of VSEdit.\nIf you already have a keyframe file\n(WWXD qp-file or Xvid keyframes)\nyou can instead use the convert function.\n# Editing a script called 'example01.vpy'\nimport ...\nfrom vsbookmark import generate\n\ngenerate(clip, 'example01')\n#convert('keyframes.txt', 'example01')\nclip.set_output()\n\nWhen previewing your clip,\nthere will now be bookmarks generated on the timeline\nallowing you to skip to the next scene using the GUI buttons.\n\n\n1. The python script may be slower than the plug-in due to the way it calls std.Splice to combine multiple re-mappings. The plug-in on the other hand, directly serves the frames of the second clip, with no calls to Splice. The speed difference will likely only be noticeable with a large amount of re-mappings. So, for the average script, it should be unnoticeable. ↩\n\n"},"encoding/masking-limiting-etc.html":{"url":"encoding/masking-limiting-etc.html","title":"Masking, Limiting, and Related Functions","keywords":"","body":"Masking, Limiting, and Related Functions\nThere are filters\nwhich change the video in various ways,\nand then there are ways to change the filtering itself.\nThere are likely hundreds of different techniques at your disposal\nfor various situations,\nusing masks to protect details from smoothing filters,\nblending two clips with different filtering applied,\nand countless others—many of which haven't been thought of yet.\nThis article will cover:\n\nMasking and Merging\nLimiting\nReference clips\nExpressions and Lookup Tables\nRuntime functions\nPrefiltering\n\nMasking\nMasking refers to a broad set of techniques used to merge multiple clips.\nUsually one filtered clip is merged with a source clip\naccording to an overlay mask clip.\nA mask clip specifies the weight for each individual pixel\naccording to which the two clips are merged;\nsee MaskedMerge for details.\nIn practice,\nmasks are usually used to protect details,\ntexture, and/or edges\nfrom destructive filtering effects like smoothing;\nthis is accomplished\nby masking the areas to protect,\ne.g. with an edgemask,\nand merging the filtered clip with the unfiltered clip\naccording to the mask,\nsuch that the masked areas are taken from the unfiltered clip,\nand the unmasked areas are taken from the filtered clip.\nIn effect,\nthis applies the filtering only to the unmasked areas of the clip,\nleaving the masked details/edges intact.\nMask clips are usually grayscale,\ni.e. they consist of only one plane and thus contain no color information.\nIn VapourSynth, such clips use the color family GRAY\nand one of these formats:\nGRAY8 (8 bits integer),\nGRAY16 (16 bits integer),\nor GRAYS (single precision floating point).\nstd.MaskedMerge\nThis is the main function for masking\nthat performs the actual merging.\nIt takes three clips as input:\ntwo source clips and one mask clip.\nThe output will be a convex combination of the input clips,\nwhere the weights are given by the brightness of the mask clip.\nThe following formula\ndescribes these internals for each pixel:\n# in 8 bpp, MAX_VALUE would be 255\noutput = clipa * (MAX_VALUE - mask) + clipb * mask\n\nIn simpler terms:\nfor brighter areas in the mask,\nthe output will come from clipb,\nand for the dark areas,\nit’ll come from clipa.\nGrey areas result in an average of clipa and clipb.\nIf premultiplied is set to True,\nthe equation changes as follows:\noutput = clipa * (MAX_VALUE - mask) + clipb\n\n\nManipulating Masks\nBuilding precise masks\nthat cover exactly what you want\nis often rather tricky.\nVapourSynth provides basic tools for manipulating masks\nthat can be used to bring them into the desired shape:\nstd.Minimum/std.Maximum\nThe Minimum/Maximum operations replace each pixel\nwith the smallest/biggest value in its 3x3 neighbourhood.\nThe 3x3 neighbourhood of a pixel\nare the 8 pixels directly adjacent to the pixel in question\nplus the pixel itself.\nImage 2.5.1 - Illustration of the 3x3 neighborhood\nThe Minimum/Maximum filters\nlook at the 3x3 neighbourhood of each pixel in the input image\nand replace the corresponding pixel in the output image\nwith the brightest (Maximum) or darkest (Minimum) pixel in that neighbourhood.\nMaximum generally expands/grows a mask\nbecause all black pixels adjacent to white edges will be turned white,\nwhereas Minimum generally shrinks the mask\nbecause all white pixels bordering on black ones will be turned black.\nSee the next section for usage examples.\nSide note:\nIn general image processing,\nthese operations are known as Erosion (Minimum)\nand Dilation (Maximum).\nMaximum/Minimum actually implement only a specific case\nwhere the structuring element is a 3x3 square.\nThe built-in morpho plug-in implements the more general case\nin the functions morpho.Erode and morpho.Dilate\nwhich allow finer control over the structuring element.\nHowever, these functions are significantly slower than\nstd.Minimum and std.Maximum.\nstd.Inflate/std.Deflate\n TODO \nstd.Binarize\nSplit the luma/chroma values of any clip into one of two values,\naccording to a fixed threshold.\nFor instance,\nbinarize an edgemask to white when edge values are at or above 24,\nand set values lower to 0:\nmask.std.Binarize(24, v0=0, v1=255)\n\nFor methods of creating mask clips,\nthere are a few general categories…\nLine masks\nThese are used for normal edge detection,\nwhich is useful for processing edges or the area around them,\nlike anti-aliasing and deringing.\nThe traditional edge detection technique is\nto apply one or more convolutions,\nfocused in different directions,\nto create a clip containing what you might call a gradient vector map,\nor more simply a clip which has brighter values in pixels\nwhere the neighborhood dissimilarity is higher.\nSome commonly used examples would be Prewitt (core),\nSobel (core),\nand kirsch (kagefunc).\nThere are also some edge detection methods that use prefiltering\nwhen generating the mask.\nThe most common of these would be TCanny,\nwhich applies a Gaussian blur before creating a 1-pixel-thick Sobel mask.\nThe most noteworthy pre-processed edge mask would be kagefunc's\nretinex_edgemask filter,\nwhich at least with cartoons and anime,\nis unmatched in its accuracy.\nThis is the mask to use if you want edge\nmasking with ALL of the edges and nothing BUT the edges.\nAnother edge mask worth mentioning is the mask in dehalohmod,\nwhich is a black-lineart mask well-suited to dehalo masking.\nInternally it uses a mask called a Camembert to generate a larger mask\nand limits it to the area affected by a line-darkening script.\nThe main mask has no name and is simply dhhmask(mode=3).\nFor more information about edgemasks,\nsee kageru's blog post.\nThe range mask\n(or in masktools,\nthe \"min/max\" mask)\nalso fits into this category.\nIt is a very simple masking method that\nreturns a clip made up of the maximum value of a range of neighboring pixels\nminus the minimum value of the range,\nas so:\nclipmax = core.std.Maximum(clip)\nclipmin = core.std.Minimum(clip)\nminmax = core.std.Expr([clipmax, clipmin], 'x y -')\n\nThe most common use of this mask is within GradFun3.\nIn theory,\nthe neighborhood variance technique is the perfect fit for a debanding mask.\nBanding is the result of 8 bit color limits,\nso we mask any pixel with a neighbor higher or lower than one 8 bit color step,\nthus masking everything except potential banding.\nBut alas,\ngrain induces false positives\nand legitimate details within a single color step are smoothed out,\ntherefore debanding will forever be a balancing act between\ndetail loss and residual artifacts.\nExample: Build a simple dehalo mask\nSuppose you want to remove these halos:\nImage 2.5.2 - Screenshot of the source.\nImage 2.5.3 - Point-enlargement of the halo area.\n(Note that the images shown in your browser are likely resized poorly;\nyou can view them at full size in this comparison.)\nFortunately, there is a well-established script that does just that:\nDeHalo_alpha.\nHowever, we must be cautious in applying that filter,\nsince, while removing halos reliably,\nit’s extremly destructive to the lineart as well.\nTherefore we must use a dehalo mask\nto protect the lineart and limit the filtering to halos.\nA dehalo mask aims to cover the halos\nbut exclude the lines themselves,\nso that the lineart won’t be blurred or dimmed.\nIn order to do that,\nwe first need to generate an edgemask.\nIn this example,\nwe’ll use the built-in Sobel function.\nAfter generating the edge mask, we extract the luma plane:\nmask = core.std.Sobel(src, 0)\nluma = core.std.ShufflePlanes(mask, 0, colorfamily=vs.GRAY)\n\nImage 2.5.4 - luma\nNext, we expand the mask twice, so that it covers the halos.\nvsutil.iterate is a function in vsutil\nwhich applies the specified filter a specified number of times\nto a clip—in this case it runs std.Maximum 2 times.\nmask_outer = vsutil.iterate(luma, core.std.Maximum, 2)\n\nImage 2.5.5 - mask_outer\nNow we shrink the expanded clip back\nto cover only the lineart.\nApplying std.Minimum twice\nwould shrink it back to the edge mask’s original size,\nbut since the edge mask covers part of the halos too,\nwe need to erode it a little further.\nThe reason we use mask_outer as the basis and shrink it thrice,\ninstead of using mask and shrinking it once,\nwhich would result in a similar outline,\nis that this way,\nsmall adjacent lines with gaps in them\n(i.e. areas of fine texture or details),\nsuch as the man’s eyes in this example,\nare covered up completely,\npreventing detail loss.\nmask_inner = vsutil.iterate(mask_outer, core.std.Minimum, 3)\n\nImage 2.5.6 - mask_inner\nNow we substract the outer mask covering the halos\nand the lineart from the inner mask covering only the lineart.\nThis yields a mask covering only the halos,\nwhich is what we originally wanted:\nhalos = core.std.Expr([mask_outer, mask_inner], 'x y -')\n\nImage 2.5.7 -

masked_dehalo\n\nDiff masks\nA diff(erence) mask is any mask clip\ngenerated using the variance of two clips.\nThere are many different ways to use this type of mask:\nlimiting a difference to a threshold,\nprocessing a filtered difference itself,\nor smoothing →\nprocessing the clean clip →\noverlaying the original grain.\nThey can also be used in conjunction with\nline masks,\nfor example:\nkagefunc's hardsubmask uses a special edge mask with a diff mask,\nand uses core.misc.Hysteresis to grow the line mask into diff mask.\nExample: Create a descale mask for white non-fading credits with extra protection for lines (16 bit input)\nsrc16 = kgf.getY(last)\nsrc32 = fvf.Depth(src16, 32)\n\nstandard_scale = core.resize.Spline36(last, 1280, 720, format=vs.YUV444P16, resample_filter_uv='spline16')\n\ninverse_scale = core.descale.Debicubic(src32, 1280, 720)\ninverse_scale = fvf.Depth(inverse_scale, 16)\n\n#absolute error of descaling\nerror = core.resize.Bicubic(inverse_scale, 1920, 1080)\nerror = core.std.Expr([src, error], 'x y -

clip2 + 128 for MakeDiff\nand clip1 + clip2 - 128 for MergeDiff,\nso pixels with no change will be gray.\nThe same is true of 16 bit and 32768.\nThe float version is simply clip1 - clip2 so in 32 bit\nthe difference is defined normally,\nnegative for dark differences,\npositive for bright differences,\nand null differences are zero.\nSince overflowing values are clipped to 0 and 255,\nchanges greater than 128 will be clipped as well.\nThis can be worked around by re-defining the input clip as so:\nsmooth = core.bilateral.Bilateral(src, sigmaS=6.4, sigmaR=0.009)\nnoise = core.std.MakeDiff(src, smooth) # subtract filtered clip from source leaving the filtered difference\nsmooth = core.std.MakeDiff(src, noise) # subtract diff clip to prevent clipping (doesn't apply to 32 bit)\n\nstd.Merge\nThis function is similar to MaskedMerge,\nthe main difference being\nthat a constant weight is supplied\ninstead of a mask clip to read the weight from for each pixel.\nThe formula is thus just as simple:\noutput = clipa * (MAX_VALUE - weight) + clipb * weight\n\nIt can be used to perform\na weighted average of two clips or planes.\nstd.Expr\n TODO \nstd.Lut and std.Lut2\nMay be slightly faster than Expr in some cases,\notherwise they can't really do anything that Expr can't.\nYou can substitute a normal Python function for the RPN expression, though,\nso you may still find it easier.\nSee link for usage information.\nLimiting\n TODO \nReferencing\n TODO  -

Bicubic B-C parameters\nRoughly speaking,\nraising B will cause blurring\nand raising C will cause ringing.\nMitchell-Netravali generalizes all smoothly fitting\n(continuous first derivative) piece-wise cubic filters,\nso any of them can be expressed with the appropiate parameters.\nBelow you can find a list of common cubic filters\nand their corresponding parameters in Mitchell-Netravali.\n\nB-Spline – b=1, c=0\nHermite – b=0, c=0\nMitchell-Netravali – b=1/3, c=1/3 (sometimes referred to as just “Mitchell”)\nCatmull-Rom – b=0, c=0.5\nSharp Bicubic – b=0, c=1\n\nHermite is often considered one of the best choices for downscaling,\nas it produces only minimal artifacting,\nat the cost of slight blurriness.\nVapourSynth example:\n# 'filter_param_a' and 'filter_param_b' refer to B and C, respectively\nclip = core.resize.Bicubic(src, w, h, filter_param_a=0, filter_param_b=0.5)\n\nLanczos\nLanczos is generally considered\na very high-quality resampler for upscaling,\nespecially its EWA version.\nIt is usually slightly sharper than Mitchell (Bicubic b=c=1/3),\nbut might produce slightly more ringing.\nLanczos takes an additional parameter\nthat controls the filter’s number of lobes,\nor taps.\nIncreasing the number of lobes\nimproves sharpness at the cost of increased ringing.\nYou might occasionally see the tap count\nappended to the filter name to clarify\nthe exact filter used, e.g. Lanczos2 for 2 taps.\nFor downscaling,\nhigher tap counts might help in\nsuppressing Moiré effects.\n# 'filter_param_a' specifies the tap count\nclip = core.resize.Lanczos(src, w, h, filter_param_a=2)\n\nSpline\nSpline is another high-quality resizer.\nSpline, like Lanczos,\ncan be finetuned by configuring its number of lobes.\nUnlike Lanczos,\nhowever,\nSplines with different tap counts are usually split\ninto seperate functions,\nwith (tap_count∗2)^2 appended to their name,\ne.g. Spline36 for 3 taps, Spline64 for 4, etc.\n(This number repesents the total amount of input pixels\ninvolved in the calculation of any given output pixel.)\nSpline36 is a very popular choice for downscaling,\nsince it is fairly artifact-free yet decently sharp.\nFor upscaling,\nit looks similiar to Lanczos3,\nthough arguably slightly less artifacted.\nVS example:\nclip = core.resize.Spline36(src, w, h)\n\nHigher tap counts can be used via fmtconv:\nclip = core.fmtc.resample(src, w, h, kernel=\"spline\", taps=6) # equivalent to Spline144\n\nGauss\nThe Gaussian filter is very special in that its Fourier transform1\nis another Gaussian\nwhose width is inversely proportional to the spatial function’s.\nThis can be harnessed to remove and amplify high frequencies\nin a very controllable way.\nWidening the filter,\nfor example,\nwill confine the output to small frequencies (blurrier),\nwhereas squashing it will amplify higher frequencies (more aliasing).\nIn practice,\nthough,\nthe Gaussian filter isn’t all too useful for regular resizing.\nHowever,\nit can be used to accurately emulate a Gaussian blur\n(when used without resizing)\nin VapourSynth.\nFor example:\nblurred = core.fmtc.resample(src, kernel=\"gauss\", fh=-1, fv=-1, a1=1)\n\nfh=-1, fv=-1 forces the processing\nwhen no resizing is performed.\na1 controls the blurring:\nthe higher,\nthe sharper the image.\nInterpolation filters\nSome sources will categorize filters as either\ninterpolation filters or non-interpolation filters.\nInterpolation filters are those that\nwhen applied “in-place”,\ni.e. at the location of the input samples,\ndon’t alter the sample value.\nTherefore,\nthey only interpolate “missing” values,\nleaving the input samples untouched.\nThis is true for filters that evaluate to 0\nat all integer positions except 0\nor whose support is \nThis can be a beneficial property in some cases,\nfor example the No-Op case.\nNo-Op means that no scaling, shifting or similiar is performed,\nthat is, the input is resampled at exactly the same positions.\nIn this case,\nan interpolation filter will return the input image untouched,\nwhereas other filters will slightly alter it.\nAnother,\nmore practical,\ncase where this property is useful\nis when shifting an image by full pixel widths (integers),\nagain because input pixel values aren’t changed\nbut just relocated.\nTwo-dimensional resampling\nThere are two different ways to go about\nresampling in two dimensions.\nTensor resampling (orthogonal, 2-pass, seperated)\nThe image is resampled in two seperate passes:\nFirst it is resampled horizontally, then vertically.\nThis allows images to be treated 1-dimensionally\nsince each pixel row/column can be resampled seperately.\nThe main advantage of this method is that it's extremly fast,\nwhich is why it’s the much more common one;\ngenerally, unless indicated otherwise,\nthis is what is used.\nElliptical Weighted Averaging (\"EWA\", cylindrical, polar, circular)\nImage 2.7.2 - Two-dimensional kernel. The radius is colored green.\nAll input samples whose Euclidian distance to the pixel\nis within the filter’s radius contribute to its value.\nThe Euclidian distance is passed to the filter kernel.\nThis is a lot more costly than tensor resampling in terms of runtime.\nScaling in modified colorspaces\nThe colorspace used when resampling\ncan significantly impact the output’s subjective quality.\nDownscaling in linear light\nDownscaling in gamma-corrected light instead of linear light\ncan sometimes noticeably dim the image.\nTo see why this happens,\nconsider this gradient:\nImage 2.7.3 - A grayscale gradient from 0 to 255.\nIt should be apparent\nthat the brightness doesn’t scale linearly with the pixel values.\nThis is because most digital video\nuses gamma-transformed pixel values\nin order to compress more perceptually distinct color shades\ninto 8 bit.\nThis causes the encoded pixel values\nto deviate from their expected brightness,\ne.g. a grey pixel has value 187 instead of 127 in sRGB.\nThis poses a problem when merging and interpolating colors,\nbecause the average pixel value of two colors no longer corresponds\nto their average perceived brightness.\nFor example,\nif you wanted to merge black and white (0 and 255),\nyou would expect to get grey,\nbut since grey actually has a value of ~187,\nthe output pixel would turn out substantially darker,\nif you were you to naively average the pixel values.\nTo calculate the correct values,\nthe gamma transform needs to be reversed before scaling\nand re-applied afterwards.\nThe dimming effect of scaling in gamma-corrected light\nis usually only noticeable\nin dense color patterns,\ne.g. small black text on a white background,\nstars in the night sky, etc,\nand much less so in blurrier areas.\nSee this comparison for a particularly extreme example\nof linear vs gamma downscaling.\nHowever,\nthis doesn’t necessarily mean downscaling in linear light\nis always the right choice,\nsince it noticeably accentuates dark halos\nintroduced by scaling.\nThus,\nit may be wise to scale in gamma light\nwhen using a resizer prone to overshooting,\nlike high-lobe Lanczos.\nBesides,\nthe dimming may even be desirable in some cases like black text on white paper,\nbecause it preserves legibility.\nIf you choose to downscale in linear light,\nmake sure to use a sufficiently high bitdepth\nso as to not introduce banding.\nExample code for resizing in linear RGB light:\nlinear = core.resize.Bicubic(src, format=vs.RGBS, transfer_in_s=\"709\", transfer_s=\"linear\", matrix_in_s=\"709\")\nscaled_linear = core.resize.Bicubic(linear, 640, 360)\nscaled_gamma = core.resize.Bicubic(scaled_linear, format=src.format, transfer_s=\"709\", transfer_in_s=\"linear\", matrix_s=\"709\")\n\nNote that the matrix_s and matrix_in_s arguments\nare only necessary when src is YUV;\notherwise, they should be omitted.\nUpscaling in sigmoidized light\nIn order to attenuate both dark and white halos\nintroduced by upscaling,\nyou can resize through a sigmoidized colorspace.\nThis means converting the linear RGB version of an image\nto a custom colorspace with an S-shaped intensitiy curve\nbefore scaling and converting it back afterwards.\nWhat this does, essentially,\nis decrease the image’s contrast\nby pushing extreme values of both dark and bright\ntowards the middle.\nQuoting Nicholas Robidoux from ImageMagick:\n\nYou may decrease halos and increase perceptual sharpness by increasing the sigmoidal contrast (up to 11.5, say).\nHigher contrasts are especially recommended with greyscale images (even \"false RGB greyscale\" that have three proportional color channels).\nThe downside of sigmoidization is that it sometimes produces \"color bleed\" artefacts that look a bit like cheap flexographic (\"gummidruck\") printing or chromatic aberration.\nIn addition, sigmoidization's \"fattening\" of extreme light and dark values may not work for your image content.\nIf such artefacts are obvious, push the contrast value down from 7.5 (to 5, for example, or even lower).\nSetting the contrast to 0 is equivalent to enlarging through linear RGB.\n\n(Robidoux, 2012)2\nExample code for VS:\nimport havsfunc as hf\nlinear = core.resize.Bicubic(src, format=vs.RGBS, transfer_in_s=\"709\", transfer_s=\"linear\", matrix_in_s=\"709\")\nsigmoidized = hf.SigmoidInverse(linear, thr=0.5, cont=6.5) # 'cont' corresponds to the “sigmoidal contrast” mentioned above\nscaled_sigmoid = core.resize.Bicubic(sigmoidized, 640, 360)\nde_sigmoidized = hf.SigmoidDirect(scaled_sigmoid, thr=0.5, cont=6.5)\nscaled_gamma = core.resize.Bicubic(de_sigmoidized, format=src.format, transfer_s=\"709\", transfer_in_s=\"linear\", matrix_s=\"709\")\n\nNeural network scalers\nNN-based scalers have become\nincreasingly popular in recent times.\nThis is because\nthey aren’t subject to the technical limitations\nof convolution-based resamplers—which beyond a certain point\nonly trade one artifact for another—and thus produce\nmuch higher quality upscales.\nNNEDI3\nThis is the current de-facto standard\nfor high-quality upscaling\nbecause it generally produces equally as sharp or sharper\nimages than conventional scalers,\nwhile avoiding any major artifacting\nsuch as haloing, ringing or aliasing.\nNnedi3 was originally conceived as a deinterlacer;\nas such,\nit only doubles a frame’s height,\nleaving the original pixel rows untouched\nand interpolating the missing ones.\nThis, however, can trivially be leveraged\nto increase image dimensions by powers of two\n(by doubling n times,\nflipping the image,\ndoubling n times again,\nand flipping back).\nUpsampling to arbitrary dimensions can be achieved\nby scaling by the smallest power of two\nthat results in a bigger image than desired,\nand downscaling to the requested resolution\nwith a conventional scaler\n(the most popular choice for this is Spline36).\nHowever,\nyou should note that\ngood quality comes at a cost:\nnnedi3 will generally be several orders of magnitude\nslower than conventional resamplers.\nVapourSynth usage example:\nfrom nnedi3_rpow2 import *\n# 'spline36' here is technically redundant since it’s the default\nup = nnedi3_rpow2(src, width=1920, height=1080, kernel=\"spline36\")\n\nShifting\nShifting an image by an arbitrary amount,\nincluding non-integer values,\nrequires resampling as well.\nFor example,\nleft-shifting by a quarter pixel\nwill resample the image at the input samples’ positions minus 0.25.3\nThis also means that,\nunless a interpolative filter is used,\neven shifting by integer amounts will alter the image.\nSide note:\nIt can be interesting to think of shifting\nnot as resampling at shifted pixel locations,\nbut as resampling at the input locations\nwith a shifted kernel.\nChroma shifting\nWhen going from 4:2:0 subsampling\nto 4:4:4 (no subsampling),\nit is important to take into account chroma placement\nand to shift the chroma accordingly\nto ensure it aligns with the luma.\nImage 2.7.4 - YUV 4:2:0 subsampling with center-aligned chroma (left) and, as per MPEG-2, left-aligned chroma (right).\nThere are two commonly used\nchroma siting patterns,\nas illustrated by the graphic above.\nMost digital video today\nuses the MPEG-2 variant,\nthat is,\nleft-aligned chroma.\nThis is essential to keep in mind\nwhen going from 4:2:0 to 4:4:4,\nbecause if the chroma planes\nare naively upscaled and joined with the luma plane without any shifting,\nthe chroma will be shifted by a quarter pixel.\nThis is a consequence of the way\noutput pixels are usually mapped onto the input grid\nduring resampling:\n 4 upscale).\">Image 2.7.5 - Pixel mapping in common resampling algorithms (2 -> 4 upscale).\nEssentially,\nthe output grid is scaled\nsuch that the outer edges of the pixel boxes align,\nimportantly under the assumption that samples are center-aligned\nwithin the pixel boxes.\nTherefore,\nwhen scaling a chroma plane by 200%,\nwhich is what happens to the chroma\nwhen going from 4:2:0 to 4:4:4,\nthe new chroma sample positions will\nmatch up with the luma sample positions.\nThis would be the correct mapping\nif the resamplers’s assumption of center-alignment was true—if it isn’t\n(like with MPEG-2 chroma placement)\nwe have to compensate for the offset by shifting the input samples\nby a quarter pixel width to the left\nbefore calculating the output samples.\nThis way,\nthe left-alignment is restored.\nSimiliarly,\nwhen resizing left-aligned 4:2:0 material\nwhile keeping the subsampling,\na slight shift needs to be applied\nto preserve the alignment.\nSpecifically,\nthe chroma needs to be shifted by\n0.25 - 0.25 * src_width/dst_width.4\nChroma shifting is performed\nautomatically under the hood by most format conversion software\n(including zimg, VapourSynth’s resizing library)\nand media players.\nThus, we only need to take care of it\nif we handle the chroma upscaling seperately by hand.\nIn VS,\nshifting can be performed with the resize functions’ src_left parameter:\nu = core.std.ShufflePlanes(src, planes=1, colorfamily=vs.GRAY)\nshifted_scaled_u = core.resize.Spline16(u, 1920, 1080, src_left=0.25) # shifts the image to the left by 0.25 pixels\n\n\n\n1.

This is derived as follows: The shift is the distance between the position of the first luma sample and the position of the first chroma sample (both mapped onto the input grid and given in terms of input chroma pixel widths). The former is located at 0.25 + (src_width/dst_width)/4, the latter at (src_width/dst_width)/2. This yields 0.25 + (src_width/dst_width)/4 - (src_width/dst_width)/2 = 0.25 + (src_width/dst_width) * (1/4 - 1/2) = 0.25 + (src_width/dst_width) * -0.25 for the shift. ↩\n\n"},"encoding/video-encoding.html":{"url":"encoding/video-encoding.html","title":"Codecs","keywords":"","body":"Video Encoding\n\n\n\nThis page is under construction.\nTo help finish this page,\nyou can contribute by clicking\n EDIT THIS PAGE\nat the top left.\n"},"typesetting/aegisub.html":{"url":"typesetting/aegisub.html","title":"Aegisub and Other Tools","keywords":"","body":"Aegisub & Other Tools\nTools\nThe first thing you'll need to do is make sure your tools are in order.\nTypesetters will need more tools than most other roles in fansubbing and\nthey need to be configured properly.\nHere is a list of tools you will want to download:\n\nAegisub\nIt is highly recommended to use CoffeeFlux's builds1 which\ninclude Dependency Control and several critical\nfixes to Aegisub that have not been merged into the official\napplication.\n\n\nA font manager\nNot all font managers are equal.
